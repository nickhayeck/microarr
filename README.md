# `microarr`: a dynamic n-dimensional array
I love storing n-dimensional arrays (and operating on them) as much as the next guy (or girl), and now you can too, by adding just a single header file!

This minimal implementation is written in C++11 and offers all the operations you've come to expect with array implementations (addition, subtraction, dot products, etc.)
